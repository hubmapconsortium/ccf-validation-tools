# Invalid terms


These are the reports related to issues in the terms found in the ASCT+B table. We validate only [CL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl), [UBERON](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon) and [PCL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/pcl) terms.
## Terms not found


This report provides a list of terms not found neither in UBERON nor in CL. Please remove these terms from the ASCT+B table.  
  
- No issues found.


## Typos or punctuation mistakes


This report provides a general quality check of the terms used in the ASCT+B table. Typos, font case (upper case), punctuation mistakes in IDs: two colons, spaces, underscore instead of a colon.  
  
- No issues found.


## Different labels


This report provides a list of terms having different names/labels found in the ontology and related to the one found in the ASCT+B table. Make sure to add the term's name/label in the column AS/N/LABEL or CT/N/LABEL. If the SME wants to give another name/label, please use the column AS/N or CT/N. N is the number in the column.

If the term's name/label and the name/label given by SME are too different, please make sure the term ID and its name/label are matching in OLS.

If the name/label in the ontology contains *obsolete*, please look into OLS, clicking on the term ID, for its replacement.  
  
1. In row _63_, the term _[CL:0000115](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000115)_ has different name/label in the source ontology. The name/label in the ASCT+B table is _endothelial_ and the one in the ontology is _endothelial cell_. For reference, the given name/label by SMEs is _endothelial_. Please correct it in the ASCT+B table.

1. In row _65_, the term _[CL:0000186](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000186)_ has different name/label in the source ontology. The name/label in the ASCT+B table is _myofibroblast_ and the one in the ontology is _myofibroblast cell_. For reference, the given name/label by SMEs is _myofibroblast_. Please correct it in the ASCT+B table.
