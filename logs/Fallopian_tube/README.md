# Invalid terms


These are the reports related to issues in the terms found in the ASCT+B table. We validate only [CL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl), [UBERON](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon) and [PCL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/pcl) terms.
## Terms not found


This report provides a list of terms not found neither in UBERON nor in CL. Please remove these terms from the ASCT+B table.  
  
- No issues found.


## Typos or punctuation mistakes


This report provides a general quality check of the terms used in the ASCT+B table. Typos, font case (upper case), punctuation mistakes in IDs: two colons, spaces, underscore instead of a colon.  
  
- No issues found.


## Different labels


This report provides a list of terms having different names/labels found in the ontology and related to the one found in the ASCT+B table. Make sure to add the term's name/label in the column AS/N/LABEL or CT/N/LABEL. If the SME wants to give another name/label, please use the column AS/N or CT/N. N is the number in the column.

If the term's name/label and the name/label given by SME are too different, please make sure the term ID and its name/label are matching in OLS.

If the name/label in the ontology contains *obsolete*, please look into OLS, clicking on the term ID, for its replacement.

## Terms from another ontology


This report provides a list of terms from another ontologies that we do not validate. Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) ontology IDs are provided when an adequate term is not found in UBERON. Also Anatomic Ontology for Human Lung Maturation (LMHA). You can also request cross-database request the same way a new term request. Please be sure if a term with a related synonym is already in the source ontologies [CL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl) or [UBERON](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon) or [PCL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/pcl).

# Relationship reports


These reports are other representations of the ASCT+B table. We split each row into pairs with adjacent terms, resulting in a table with two primary columns, object (o), left side and subject (s), right side. The experts' labels for the subject and object are in the columns user_slabel and user_olabel. The other columns are the subject label (s_label) and object label (o_label), the label from the source ontologies.

The report means it could not find a partonomy relationship in the source ontologies, but it doesn't mean this relationship is entirely invalid. In some cases, the pair is in the *inverse order*. In other cases, the relationship is *missing* in the source ontologies. Finally, how it was modelled in the ASCT+B table is not aligned with the ontologies sources and needs a more general discussion.
## Relationship AS-AS report


In the case of the AS-AS relationship, for each couple of terms, we verify for _sub class of, part of and overlaps_ in the source ontologies. The column **deltaIC** is here for help finding terms in a general location. It means the Information Content difference between the terms in the columns s and o. A large number (>50) can tell that the two terms are in a general location.

## Relationship CT-CT report


In the case of the CT-CT relationship, for each couple of terms, we verify for _sub class of, part of and overlaps_ in the source ontologies. The column **deltaIC** is here for help finding terms in a general location. It means the Information Content difference between the terms in the columns s and o. A large number (>50) can tell that the two terms are in a general location.



- No issues found.


## Relationship CT-AS report


In the case of the AS-CT relationship, for each couple of terms, we verify for _connected to and has part_ in the source ontologies.
