Verify if there isn't a gap between the two levels without UBERON or CL terms in the ASCT+B table.</p> <p>Please ensure that there isn't the same term in two levels on the same row.

We use the relationship ccf_located_in to link CL to UBERON terms and ccf_part_of to link UBERON terms. They are non-validated relationships.</p> <p>The blue, black, or dark green edges are relationships in the CL or Uberon ontologies. They are valid relationships.</p> <p>The light green edges are relationships in the CL or Uberon ontologies. There is at least one light green edge as a suggestion relationship when there's a red edge. If there isn't a light green edge for a red edge, there isn't in the ontology a relationship between the original term and any other term in the graph.</p> <p>Please ensure that all terms have a relationship that is part of the path to the leading term in the ASCT+B table. Verify if there isn't a gap between the two levels without UBERON or CL terms in the ASCT+B table.</p> <p>Please ensure that there isn't the same term in two levels on the same row. In the graph, it is represented as a red-edge relationship to the term itself.</p> <p>View image as PDF</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Peripheral_nervous_system/","title":"ASCT+B Validation Reports for Peripheral_nervous_system (2026-02-25)","text":""},{"location":"Peripheral_nervous_system/#table-of-contents","title":"Table of contents","text":"<ul> <li>Invalid terms<ul> <li>Terms not found</li> <li>Typos or punctuation mistakes</li> <li>Different labels</li> <li>Blank ontology ID</li> <li>Blank ontology ID missing parent</li> <li>Terms from another ontology</li> </ul> </li> <li>Relationship reports<ul> <li>How to read a table entry</li> <li>Relationship AS-AS report</li> <li>Relationship CT-CT report</li> <li>Relationship CT-AS report</li> </ul> </li> <li>New CL terms</li> <li>New UBERON terms</li> <li>Informative reports (valid relationships)<ul> <li>Indirect relationship</li> <li>Relationship AS has part CT</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Peripheral_nervous_system/#invalid-terms","title":"Invalid terms","text":"<p>These are the reports related to issues in the terms found in the ASCT+B table.

We use the relationship ccf_located_in to link CL to UBERON terms and ccf_part_of to link UBERON terms. They are non-validated relationships.</p> <p>The blue, black, or dark green edges are relationships in the CL or Uberon ontologies. They are valid relationships.</p> <p>The light green edges are relationships in the CL or Uberon ontologies. There is at least one light green edge as a suggestion relationship when there's a red edge. If there isn't a light green edge for a red edge, there isn't in the ontology a relationship between the original term and any other term in the graph.</p> <p>Please ensure that all terms have a relationship that is part of the path to the leading term in the ASCT+B table. Verify if there isn't a gap between the two levels without UBERON or CL terms in the ASCT+B table.</p> <p>Please ensure that there isn't the same term in two levels on the same row.
